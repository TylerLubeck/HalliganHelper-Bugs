# HalliganHelper Bug Tracker

This repository will serve as the bug tracker for www.halliganhelper.com. 

### Why?

We're trying to encourage more open communication between everyone who uses 
the site and everyone who makes the site. Rather than having bug reports and
complaints trickle through the halls of Halligan, let's record them here so 
that we can let you know what we're working on. 

### How To Submit A Bug

1. Head on over to the [issues][issues] tab.
2. Search to see if the problem has already been reported
   *  If it has, and you have additional information that you think would be 
      helpful, leave a comment!
   * Please do not leave any "Me too!" type comments. We'll probably lock 
     comment threads with too much noise, as it doesn't help us get to the root 
     of a problem. 
   * If you feel that an issue is particularly important, then use one these 
     new github reactions! Popular issues will help influence our future work.

3. If you can't find an existing issue, make a new one. We've added a nifty 
   template for reporting issues. While many fields are optional, we ask that
   you provide as much information as you can.
